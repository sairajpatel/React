React is considered as library not frame-work.
React creats it's own virtual dom.
React provides you to render html in js by declaring there there tags 
While creating projects with vite use .jsx instead of js just because it is an requirment of vite library

Imp:- Component function name should be capitalized for first letter otherwise it won't run!

React manipulates the virtual dom rather than manipulating the orginal dom after it makes changes in real dom.

React creates the virtual dom.

react trees has={
    type'a',
    props:{
        href:'https :google.Com',
        target:"_blank"
    },
    children:'Click me to visit google'
}
to render above tree customRender is used to render above tree with id of html.
to create manullay by object by react:-
React.createElement(
    'a',
    {href:'https:google.com',target:'_blank'},
    'click me to visit google'
)
imp:-we cannont write declare variables in that object because react dom object does not allow to declare it 
You can just call it.

React Router is not offical libaray it's third party library.

React router mainly uses to links one Link and other one is navlinks there is no such a difference between both 

RouterProvider always takes props of router.
